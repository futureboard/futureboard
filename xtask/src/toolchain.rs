//! Bridge to the Professional Edition build toolchain.
//!
//! Provisioning the Steinberg ASIO SDK — the download URL, the licence
//! acceptance gate, the archive-layout validation, and the libclang lookup that
//! `asio-sys` needs for bindgen — is Professional Edition build tooling and
//! lives in the Git-ignored `crates/ExclusiveEdition/xtask/toolchain.rs`.
//!
//! `build.rs` stages that file when the private checkout is present and sets
//! `professional_toolchain`. A public Community checkout compiles the stub
//! below instead, so `cargo xtask build-all` / `package --edition professional`
//! stop with an explanation rather than failing to compile.
//!
//! The bridge deliberately uses `include!` rather than a `#[path]` module, for
//! the same reason `apps/native/studio/src/professional_edition.rs` does:
//! rustfmt resolves `#[path]` modules even when they are cfg'd out, which would
//! make formatting the public workspace require the private source tree.
