//! Swept-allpass stereo phasers — one engine, several voiced circuits.
//!
//! A phaser is not the allpass cascade on its own. The cascade has a flat
//! magnitude response by construction, so what you hear is the *sum* of the
//! dry path and the cascade: where the two arrive in antiphase the sum
//! cancels, and those moving nulls are the effect. Feeding back around the
//! cascade lifts the peaks between the nulls, which is the resonant "vowel"
//! character of an OTA pedal.
//!
//! Two consequences drive everything below:
//!
//! * The blend has a maximum. Notch depth peaks at an equal dry/wet sum and
//!   falls away on either side, so a Mix control has to reach 50% wet and
//!   stop. Running it to 100% wet returns the bare cascade — flat, and very
//!   nearly inaudible.
//! * Notch *count* is the stage count. Every two allpass stages buys one
//!   null, so a four-stage circuit has two and a twelve-stage has six. That,
//!   not depth or rate, is what separates a discreet Phase 90 from the
//!   swirling multi-notch boxes.
//!
//! Voices differ in stage count, regeneration, sweep span, whether the stages
//! share a corner or are staggered like a Univibe's unequal capacitors, LFO
//! symmetry and stereo spread. All state is fixed-size; nothing here
//! allocates or branches on unbounded data.
