//! Impulse-response cabinet engine — a real convolution alternative to the
//! modeled [`super::cab::Cabinet`], selectable as [`super::CabModel::Ir`].
//!
//! Loading a `.wav` IR decodes, resamples, trims and FFTs it into partition
//! spectra — allocation-heavy control-thread work, exactly like a NAM capture.
//! [`prepare_ir_runtime`] does that off the audio thread and hands back a
//! [`PreparedIrRuntime`] the caller boxes and pushes into [`IrLoader::submit`].
//! The audio thread adopts it at a block boundary
//! ([`IrConvolver::begin_block`]), briefly ducking through the swap, and the
//! retired runtime goes back to the control thread to be dropped — never
//! inside [`IrConvolver::process`].
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! Uniform-partitioned overlap-save: the IR is cut into [`PARTITION`]-sample
//! chunks, each zero-padded to [`FFT_SIZE`] and transformed once at load time.
//! Every [`PARTITION`] input samples the convolver transforms one
//! double-length input block, pushes it into a frequency-delay line, and
//! accumulates the FDL against the partition spectra. Latency is exactly
//! [`PARTITION`] samples, reported to the host for delay compensation.
//!
//! Three things keep that affordable:
//!
//! - **Both channels ride one transform.** Left goes in the real plane and
//!   right in the imaginary one, so a stereo block costs one forward and one
//!   inverse FFT instead of four. The two real spectra are untangled from the
//!   packed transform with a handful of adds per bin.
//! - **Only half of each spectrum is stored.** A real signal's transform is
//!   conjugate-symmetric, so DC..Nyquist ([`BINS`]) is the whole of the
//!   information — halving both the frequency-delay line and the
//!   multiply-accumulate loop that dominates the cost.
//! - **Real and imaginary parts live in separate planes**, so that loop is a
//!   pair of contiguous `f32` sweeps a compiler can vectorize, rather than a
//!   stride-2 walk over interleaved complex values.
//!
//! Cost still scales with IR length, which is why [`MAX_IR_SECONDS`] caps it
//! and why the inaudible tail is trimmed at load ([`TAIL_ENERGY_FLOOR`]): this
//! is a *cabinet* IR engine, and a uniform partitioning is the wrong shape for
//! a multi-second reverb tail.
//!
//! ## Realtime rules
//!
//! Every buffer — partition spectra, FDL, FFT scratch, block accumulators —
//! is allocated in [`prepare_ir_runtime`] or [`IrConvolver::new`].
//! [`IrConvolver::process`] performs no allocation, locking or logging.
