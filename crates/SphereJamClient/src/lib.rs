//! Futureboard Audio Jam — the native client.
//!
//! This crate talks to the Futureboard Jam Server: REST for the control plane,
//! one WebSocket for signaling, and a binary media plane over UDP, TCP or TLS.
//! It is the same protocol the browser listener speaks, translated from the
//! server's own `pkg/protocol`, so a Studio and a web guest are two clients of
//! one room rather than two nearly-compatible implementations.
//!
//! # What this crate is not
//!
//! It owns **no audio device, no mixer, no resampler and no UI**. Futureboard
//! Studio already has all four, and a jam that opened its own capture stream
//! would fight the DAW for the hardware. Instead the host implements two small
//! traits — [`bridge::JamAudioSink`] for arriving audio and
//! [`bridge::JamPublishSource`] for outgoing audio — and the engine keeps
//! owning the device:
//!
//! ```text
//! hardware ─▶ Futureboard Audio Engine ─▶ JamPublishSource ─▶ jam
//! jam ─▶ JamAudioSink ─▶ Futureboard Audio Engine ─▶ track
//! ```
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! Three, none of them the audio thread:
//!
//! * `jam-control` owns the signaling socket, the room registry and the
//!   reconnect policy.
//! * `jam-media-rx` reads packets, reorders them, decodes them and calls the
//!   sink.
//! * `jam-media-tx` pulls from publish sources and puts packets on the wire.
//!
//! The sink is expected to copy into a lock-free ring the audio callback
//! drains, and a publish source to drain a ring the audio callback fills. No
//! call in this crate is ever made from a realtime context.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! `user_id` is immutable and is the only value anything routes on. A username
//! is a display alias its owner may change and someone else may later take, so
//! nothing here keys a map on one. One account may hold several participants in
//! the same jam — a laptop and a phone are two devices — so participants are
//! keyed by participant id and merely *grouped* by account for display.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use sphere_jam_client::{
//!     bridge::NullSink,
//!     config::JamConfig,
//!     credentials::{CredentialFn, SharedCredentials},
//!     ids::JamId,
//!     session::{JamSession, JamSessionOptions},
//! };
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let config = JamConfig::from_env()?;
//! let credentials: SharedCredentials =
//!     Arc::new(CredentialFn(|| Ok("the host's account token".to_string())));
//! let options = JamSessionOptions::new("studio-mac", Arc::new(NullSink));
//!
//! let session = JamSession::spawn(config, credentials, options)?;
//! session.join(JamId::new("jam_01K4S8QP0M9TZ3B7VNXW1D5CJH"), "")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
