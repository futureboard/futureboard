//! Where jam audio meets the host application.
//!
//! This crate deliberately owns no audio device, no resampler and no mixer. It
//! hands decoded interleaved `f32` to a sink the host provides and pulls blocks
//! from sources the host provides; Futureboard Studio implements both against
//! its existing engine, so the jam gains no second audio path and the engine
//! gains no knowledge of sockets.
//!
//! Timing is the part that has to be right here. Every delivered frame carries
//! two different timestamps and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! * **Capture timestamp** — the session tick at which the publisher captured
//!   the first sample. It is what a recording is aligned against. Network delay
//!   does not appear in it.
//! * **Presentation timestamp** — when this receiver intends to play the frame.
//!   It carries the jitter buffer's depth and is a monitoring concern only.
//!
//! Using arrival time for either would put a remote take at a position that
//! depends on the weather of the network, which is exactly the bug the session
//! clock exists to prevent.
