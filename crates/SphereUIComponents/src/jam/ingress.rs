//! What this Studio asks the jam to send it.
//!
//! ```txt
//! Audio Connections (inputs bound to jam:<stream>) ──▶ routed set ──▶ subscribe
//! ```
//!
//! Egress was always explicit — a Studio publishes what it chooses. Ingress was
//! not: the server sent every participant every stream it could decode, and a
//! Studio decoded all of it whether or not anything read it.
//!
//! That waste is not theoretical, and it is worse here than anywhere else in
//! the room. A remote stream only becomes audible in Studio by way of an Audio
//! Connection: the sink writes it into a jam bus input slot, and the audio
//! callback reads that slot **only** when some track's input connection binds
//! `jam:<stream_id>`. A stream nobody routed was therefore received, reordered,
//! decoded, resampled and thrown away — at roughly 1.5 Mbit/s per 48 kHz stereo
//! stream, on the uplink that is already the constraint in a jam.
//!
//! So the routing registry decides. Every enabled input connection that binds a
//! jam port is a stream this Studio wants; everything else in the room is
//! announced, listed in the panel, and not sent. A stream that is wanted but not
//! published yet stays wanted — a track bound to a performer who has not started
//! is a track waiting, and the jam client attaches it when they publish.
//!
//! Nothing here is called from an audio callback.
