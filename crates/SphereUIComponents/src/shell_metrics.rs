//! Measured heights of the application shell's top chrome.

//! These are **coordinate-space constants**, not styling. The timeline converts
//! window-space Y into arrangement-local Y by subtracting [`APP_CHROME_HEIGHT`],
//! so ruler ticks, clip hit-testing, note drags, automation points and the
//! tempo track all depend on this number being exactly the drawn height of the
//! chrome above them.

//! It used to be a bare `const APP_CHROME_HEIGHT: f32 = 36.0` copy-pasted into
//! three separate timeline files, each with a comment saying it "mirrors" the
//! others. Splitting the chrome into a titlebar plus a transport bar would have
//! silently desynchronised all three — the arrangement would still *draw*
//! correctly while every click landed one bar too high. One definition now.

/// `platform_chrome::TITLEBAR_HEIGHT_PX` (32) plus its 1 px bottom border: the
/// extra was tuned by hand against the running app, and changing it shifts
/// every arrangement hit-test by a few pixels. If it is wrong it should be
/// fixed deliberately, with the timeline re-verified — not as a side effect.
