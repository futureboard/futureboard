//! Track outputs as Audio Connections input ports.
//!
//! ```txt
//! Instrument track ──▶ trk:<track id> ──▶ Input menu ──▶ Audio track
//! ```
//!
//! This is what makes "record my VSTi to an audio track" an ordinary routing
//! choice rather than a bounce: the instrument shows up in the same Input menu
//! a hardware channel does, an audio track points at it, and arming that track
//! records the instrument's post-fader output.
//!
//! Modelled on [`crate::jam`]'s stream ports, and for the same reason: one
//! routing layer, with stable ids and non-destructive behaviour when the source
//! disappears, instead of a second private one beside it. The only difference
//! is the device-id prefix — see [`DirectAudio::loopback`].
//!
//! The source list is a process-wide snapshot the studio republishes whenever
//! the track list changes, because [`crate::audio_connections::current_available_ports`]
//! has no view of the project and should not grow one.
