//! The deterministic accent rule, and the coefficients it was fitted with.
//!
//! Two jobs. It is the analyser the editor uses when no model is loaded — every
//! Solfege instrument has a rule, only some carry a trained one — and it is the
//! baseline the trained analyser has to beat before it is worth shipping.
//!
//! The coefficients are **fitted, not chosen**. Nine interpretable score
//! features, ridge-regressed against the URMP-derived accent targets on the
//! training split, and copied here verbatim from the training report by
//! `neural/scripts/export_accent.py`. That is the only honest way to document a
//! constant in a file like this: a hand-tuned weight is taste presented as
//! measurement, and there is no ground truth to tune against — which is the
//! entire difficulty this system exists to work around.
//!
//! The features are nine rather than the analyser's thirty-three because each
//! one has to be something a musician would say out loud as a reason a note is
//! emphasised. A coefficient on `is_window_peak` is a claim that can be argued
//! with; a coefficient on the eleventh hidden unit of a GRU is not.
