//! Metrical structure: where a note sits in its bar, and what that is worth.
//!
//! A bar is not a list of equal slots. Beat 1 of a 4/4 bar is not beat 2, beat
//! 3 is not beat 2 either, and the eighth between them is weaker again — that
//! hierarchy is what makes a note on a weak subdivision *sound* like it is
//! pushing against something.
//!
//! Nothing here is specific to 4/4. The grid comes from the time signature, and
//! specifically from the same [`TimeSignaturePoint::effective_grouping`] the
//! bar ruler already draws, so a 7/8 the user has regrouped as 3+2+2 is
//! analysed the way it is displayed. A 3/2 bar is six quarter-note beats, not
//! three: bar length is `numerator * 4 / denominator`, and reading the
//! numerator alone folds two bars into one and puts every other downbeat on
//! beat 3.
//!
//! This file is the runtime half of a pair. `neural/accent/meter.py` is the
//! training half, function for function and constant for constant, and
//! `accent::parity` checks the two against a shared fixture — a model trained
//! on one grid and run against another has been given different music from the
//! one it was taught on.
