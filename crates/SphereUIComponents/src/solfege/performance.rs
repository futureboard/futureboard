//! Applying a generated performance to a MIDI clip.
//!
//! The FBMX Performer predicts *how a score is played* — where each note lands,
//! how long it is held, how loud it is, and how its pitch moves inside it. What
//! arrives here is that prediction as a performance document, and what leaves is
//! ordinary clip data: notes with the start, duration, and velocity they were
//! given, and a [`PitchCurve`] on each one.
//!
//! That is the whole point. There is no separate AI-owned performance state and
//! nothing about a generated curve marks it as generated: the Pitch editor draws
//! it because it draws every curve, a drag on one of its points edits it the way
//! it edits a hand-drawn one, and deleting the curve returns the note to its
//! notated pitch. A user who never runs the Performer has a project that behaves
//! exactly as it did before.
//!
//! The document is the same JSON the offline renderer already reads, so a
//! performance can be rendered to a file and applied to a clip without two
//! descriptions of the same thing drifting apart.
