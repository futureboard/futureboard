//! Compile the logical [`AudioConnectionRegistry`] into an immutable runtime
//! routing snapshot the audio callback can consume directly.
//!
//! ```txt
//! AudioConnectionRegistry + track assignments
//!     -> validate ids
//!     -> resolve device + stable port ids
//!     -> resolve physical channel indexes
//!     -> EngineAudioRoutingSnapshot   (immutable, Arc-swapped)
//!     -> audio callback
//! ```
//!
//! Everything expensive happens here, on the control thread. The snapshot holds
//! only pre-resolved integers, so the callback never parses an id, hashes a
//! string, walks a UI model, locks, or allocates. A connection that is missing,
//! disabled, or invalid compiles to *silence* — never to a fallback channel,
//! because monitoring or recording the wrong physical input is worse than
