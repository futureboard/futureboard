//! Process-global edition / license status surfaced to shared UI (the About
//! page in Settings).
//!
//! This module holds **no** license logic and **no** signing keys. It is a
//! dependency-free hand-off point: the shared crate must never depend on the
//! private Professional Edition crate, so the Professional build's app layer installs
//! a provider here and the shared About panel reads from it. A Community build
//! installs nothing and the About panel falls back to its plain edition info.
//!
//! The provider is a closure so it stays fresh: the About panel re-reads license
//! state each time it is shown, which is exactly what lets an activation — or a
//! background renewal on a later launch — appear without special refresh wiring.
//! It is called only from the (rare, user-driven) Settings render, never a hot
//! path.
