//! Record fan-out for the persistent capture stream.
//!
//! # Why a tap
//!
//! Recording used to *be* a stream: pressing Record stopped the live input
//! stream and opened a new one, and Stop dropped that and re-opened the monitor
//! stream. Opening and closing a capture client mid-session is not free — it
//! renegotiates the endpoint, restarts a realtime thread and re-primes the
//! device buffer — and that is heard as a stutter at both ends of every take,
//! on the two moments a performer is least willing to hear one.
//!
//! So the stream stays. It is opened when a track is armed or monitored and
//! lives until the routing changes; a take is a *sink* installed into the
//! callback that is already running, and Stop removes it. Nothing in the device
//! path moves when recording starts or stops.
//!
//! This is the shape the ASIO session has always used
//! ([`crate::backend::asio_session::RecordSink`]); this module is the same
//! contract for the cpal backends, kept separate because the two callbacks own
//! different buffers and neither should have to grow a branch for the other.
//!
//! # Realtime contract
//!
//! The callback never allocates, locks, or deallocates:
//!
//! * commands arrive on a bounded channel drained at block start;
//! * a sink is carried boxed, so installing and retiring one moves a pointer;
//! * a retired sink leaves through a bounded trash channel, so both the
//!   `Sender` disconnect (which finalizes the disk writer) and the box's
//!   deallocation happen on the control thread;
//! * a full trash channel is not a reason to deallocate on the audio thread —
//!   the sink is held until there is room.
