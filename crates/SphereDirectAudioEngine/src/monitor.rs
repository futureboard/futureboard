//! Control Room / Listen Bus — the monitoring path that sits *after* the
//! master bus and feeds the physical monitoring output.
//!
//! ```txt
//! Tracks / Instruments / Aux / Returns / Groups
//!     -> Master Bus (+ master inserts, master fader)
//!     -> Monitor Source Router
//!     -> Listen (PFL/AFL) override
//!     -> Monitor Insert Chain
//!     -> Monitor Control (mono -> dim -> gain -> mute)
//!     -> Selected hardware output pair
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties are structural rather than enforced by checks:
//!
//! * **Playback-only.** Every stage here runs inside the realtime device
//!   callback (`backend::render::fill_output_f32_inner`). Offline export, stem
//!   export, and recording all render through
//!   [`crate::engine::render_project_block_interleaved_with_taps`], which never
//!   enters the device callback — so no Control Room stage can reach exported
//!   or recorded audio. (Requirement: monitor gain/FX must not affect export.)
//!
//! * **No duplicate output path.** The Control Room *replaces* the samples on
//!   its target output pair instead of summing into them, and the master mix is
//!   written to the device buffer exactly once by the graph. The same hardware
//!   output therefore can never carry both the raw master feed and the
//!   monitored feed.
//!
//! The monitor bus is deliberately **not** bound to a hardware input. A
//! hardware input is only one selectable source among several, and is never the
//! default — see [`MonitorSource`].

/// Where the Control Room takes its signal from when no Listen (PFL/AFL) is
/// engaged.
///
/// [`MonitorSource::MasterBus`] is the default and is what a DAW monitors
/// almost all of the time: the complete internal mix — audio tracks,
/// instrument tracks, aux/send buses, return channels, group buses, and master
/// insert processing — because it is tapped from the master bus output rather
