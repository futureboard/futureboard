//! Realtime-safe sink the audio callback uses to exchange one block with the
//! external plugin host (Stage 3b of the shared-memory audio bridge).
//!
//! DAUx defines the contract; `sphere-plugin-host` implements it over the
//! shared-memory region (it cannot live there — the engine must not depend on
//! the host crate). **Every method runs on the audio thread**, so each must be
//! wait-free: no allocation, no locks, no syscalls, no blocking.
